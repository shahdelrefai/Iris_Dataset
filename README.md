# Iris Dataset

**Structure of Iris dataset:**

* Number of samples: 150
* Number of features: 4
* Number of classes: 3 (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)
* Target: A label indicating the class (species) to which the flower belongs.

**Each sample consists of four features (attributes) related to the physical characteristics of the flowers:**
1.   Sepal length
2.   Sepal width
3.   Petal length
4.   Petal width

**Target (output variable): The species of the flower**

0: Setosa
1: Versicolor
2: Virginica



| Attribute Name         | Description                                      | Data Type | Range                     |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------------------------|
| **sepal length (cm)**  | Length of the sepal (the outer part of the flower) | Float     | 4.3 to 7.9                |
| **sepal width (cm)**   | Width of the sepal                              | Float     | 2.0 to 4.4                |
| **petal length (cm)**  | Length of the petal                            | Float     | 1.0 to 6.9                |
| **petal width (cm)**   | Width of the petal                             | Float     | 0.1 to 2.5                |
| **flower**             | Species of the flower                          | Categorical | Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica |


# Objectives
```
1. Plot the histogram for each class.
2. Use scatter plot to plot every 2 attributes together.
3. Use 3D scatter plot to plot every 3 attributes together.
4. Show the correlation matrix between the attributes and comment on it.
5. Use boxplots to show the quartiles and the median of the sepal length, sepal width, petal length
   and petal width for each kind of flowers.
